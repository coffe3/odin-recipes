        <h1>Irish Soda Farls</h1>
        <img src="/images/sodafarls.jpg" Height="230" width="300">
        <p>Farl means four parts in Gaelic           and this recipe is the traditional
        (and quickest) way to make soda
        bread farls for unexpected guests 
        who drop by for a bit of "craic"
        (good fun). The soda bread dough is
        flattened into a round, then cooked 
        on a dry griddle or pan. It's best 
        eaten fresh with butter and jam but 
        is also delicious pan-fried in oil 
        or butter as part of an "Ulster fry."</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>2 cups all-purpose flour</li>
            <li>Â½ teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon baking soda</li>
            <li>1 cup buttermilk</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Directions</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Preheat a heavy based flat 
                griddle or skillet on medium 
                to low heat.
            </li>
            <li>Place flour and salt in a 
                bowl and sift in baking soda; 
                make a well in the center, 
                and pour in the buttermilk.
            </li>
            <li>Work quickly to mix into a 
                wet dough; knead very lightly 
                on a well floured surface. 
                Form into a flattened circle, 
                about 1/2 inch thick and cut 
                into quarters with a floured 
                knife. The dough will be quite 
                sticky.
            </li>
            <li>Sprinkle a little flour over 
                the base of the hot pan and 
                cook the farls for 6 to 8 minutes 
                on each side or until golden brown.
            </li>
        </ol>
